### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name's Anthony! I'm a web developer building my skill set at the Turing School of Software & Design. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning object-oriented programming, test-driven development, and heavy data manipulation.
- âš¡ Fun fact: In a former life, I was an Arabic/Chinese linguist and ballroom dancer instructor.

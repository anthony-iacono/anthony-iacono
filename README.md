## About Me

**I have an insatiable curiosity and love of learning** that drive me to continuously expand my knowledge, build my skillset, and challenge the status quo. As a dance instructor, I spent hours before and after work each day with senior instructors and coaches refining my technical skills as a dancer and my soft skills as a teacher. Now that I am a software engineer, I apply these same habits to learning all that I can from my colleagues, supervisors, and mentors, allowing me to build better products with each iteration.

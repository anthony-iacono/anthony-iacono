## About Me

**I learn best by getting my hands dirty solving real-world problems.** While training to become an Arabic/Chinese linguist in the military, I realized that the sooner I grappled with difficult, authentic language material, the more I learned. The same grit and growth mindset I developed in training and on deployment have enabled me to hit the ground running as a software engineer solving new problems each day.

**I have an insatiable curiosity and love of learning** that drive me to continuously expand my knowledge, build my skillset, and challenge the status quo. As a dance instructor, I spent hours before and after work each day with senior instructors and coaches refining my technical skills as a dancer and my soft skills as a teacher. Now that I am a software engineer, I apply these same habits to learning all that I can from my colleagues, supervisors, and mentors, allowing me to build better products with each iteration.

**I'm at my best on teams that value close collaboration and direct feedback.** In my work as a military linguist, I built collaborative relationships within and across teams to collect and share relevant, time-sensitive information that helped ensure the safety of everyone on base. Our success was built on the trust we had in each other, and the trust others placed in us. My work as a software engineer places similar emphasis on teamwork and trustworthiness, whether I'm giving honest feedback in code reviews, addressing security vulnerabilities, or doing any of the other things, big and small, that secure the confidence of the end user.
